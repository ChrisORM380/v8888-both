# v8888-both
both versions of v8888.
also, JUST PLEASE don't run those programs on other's pcs, unless the pc's owner lets you. BUT STILL, I DON'T RECCOMEND RUNNING THOSE PROGRAMS. If you want to run those programs, use a virtual machine instead. AND LASTLY, THOSE PROGRAMS CONTAIN MINDLESS WINDOW MOVING,MINDLESS MOUSE MOVEMENT, LABEL CHANGING, MINDLESS MOUSE CLICKING FLASHING LIGHTS AND LOUD NOISES.
